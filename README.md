|    0b. | Documentation               | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes and send test transactions, which will show how the new functionality works.                                                                  |
|    0c. | Testing Guide               | Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests.                                                                                                                                                              |
|    0d. | Docker                      | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|    0e. | Article                     | We will publish an **article**/workshop that explains our advertising workflow as well as technical details.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|     1. | Substrate module: ad        | We will create a Substrate module that will allow advertiser to create impression ads, and with council's approval, this ad will be ready to be displayed. If ads are rejected by the council(e.g. illegal or pornographic content), the advertiser's proposal bond will be slashed and collected in treasury. |
|     2. | Substrate module: user mock | We will create a Substrate module that will first store users data on chain, to test and verify our logic. Also, user can update their data, control what data should be used, and these data are used to find the best matching ad for user.                                                                  |
|     3. | Substrate chain             | Module ad and user can be integrated into a substrate node, to enable users access of all approved ads, receive rewards, etc. This chain will integrate treasury, council, democracy and also other essential pallets, to build a full-featured blockchain.                                                    |
|     4. | Web App                     | We will create a web app, to let users easily interact with our substrate node. Users can claim rewards from viewing and clicking ads, and they can also configure their ad preferences and decide if they are willing to view ads or not.                                                                     |

## Future Plans

The next step is to have sensitive data stored in TEE. Also, we will build more ad types, like click ads and acquisition/action ads. Meanwhile, we will implement a Chrome extension to simplify the claim process, and an Ad asset on Decentraland(or other Metaverse platform) to enable land holders to use our ad assets conveniently.

In a long run, we will cooperate and adapt our products with more Metaverse platforms, and also we will develop more creative and interactive ad types.
